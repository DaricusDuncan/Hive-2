## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. **Do Not** create a public issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security concerns to [security@example.com]
3. Include detailed steps to reproduce
4. Provide impact assessment if possible
5. Allow 48 hours for initial response

## Security Best Practices

### Password Requirements

- Minimum 8 characters
- Mix of uppercase and lowercase
- Include numbers and special characters
- No common dictionary words

### Token Management

### API Usage

- Use HTTPS for all requests
- Include authentication headers
- Validate response data
- Handle rate limiting gracefully

## Development Guidelines

### Code Security

- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Use parameterized queries
- Validate all user input
- Implement proper error handling

### Dependency Management

- Regular security updates
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Dependency version pinning
- Security patch monitoring

### Environment Security

- Use environment variables for secrets
- Secure configuration management
- Production environment hardening
- Regular security audits

## Incident Response

1. Immediate issue containment
2. Impact assessment
3. Root cause analysis
4. Fix implementation
5. Post-mortem review
